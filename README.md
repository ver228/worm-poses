Once the model is repository you can execute, where DATADIR is the path to the training data, and SAVEDIR is the path where the model is going to be saved.

```
python -m worm_poses.train \
--n_epochs 3000 \
--data_type 'v5' \
--data_dir $DATADIR \
--save_dir $SAVEDIR \
--model_name 'openpose+light+head' \
--loss_type 'maxlikelihood' \
--batch_size 24 \
--num_workers 8 \
--lr 1e-4 \
--save_frequency 600
```

There are more examples of training configs in the folder `train_cmd`.
